# Horiseon Accessability Optimisation

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

This project has refactored existing code to a SEO website to improve accessability, particularly for people who use assistive technologies.

## Changes

The HTML file has been tidied up to follow logical strcuture of HTML semantics.

The CSS file has been condensed to provide ease-of-access to make any future adjustments.

Each image has been given alternate text to provide a desrciption for scree readers and enhance accessability.
